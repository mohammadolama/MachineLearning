# MachineLearning
This is a Python notebook in which we develop a binary cancer classifier and detector using classical and deep learning models. We tried Random Forests as a classical model, and Neural Networks as a deep learning model.

The data set features is splitted to three seperate sets and the data itself is splitted in three different sets (e.g., train, validation, and test sets). 

Then our models are trained on two of these sets seperately, and they are tested on their test data, respectively.

This procedure aimed to compare the performance of those methods on the different data feature set.

We also used PCA, Umap, and random forests' feature selection property to identify which attributes of the data were more important and informative.
