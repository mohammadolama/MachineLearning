# MachineLearning

This repository contains homework assignments and final project for the course "[Machine Learning](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning)"

### Project
This is a Python notebook in which we develop a binary cancer classifier and detector using classical and deep learning models. We tried Random Forests as a classical model, and Neural Networks as a deep learning model.

The data set features is splitted to three seperate sets and the data itself is splitted in three different sets (e.g., train, validation, and test sets). 

Then our models are trained on two of these sets seperately, and they are tested on their test data, respectively.

This procedure aimed to compare the performance of those methods on the different data feature set.

We also used PCA, Umap, and random forests' feature selection property to identify which attributes of the data were more important and informative.


### HW2 
This directory contains solutions to 2nd practical assignments.

These homeworks focused on classical models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM. These methods were applied on different datasets.


### HW3
This directory contains solutions to 3rd practical assignments.

These homeworks focused on basic deep learning models like Multi-Layer perceptron(MLP). In one of the assignments we build a neural network from the ground using just "Numpy" library.

### HW4
This directory contains solutions to last practical assignments.

These homeworks focused on more advanced deep learning models like CNN, RNN, and Auto encoders.

CNN: create a deep model to recognize and classify handwritten 0-8 digits.

RNN: Image Captioning using Recurrent Neural Networks

AutoEncoders: Compress and decompress a covid-19 dataset with minimal loss
